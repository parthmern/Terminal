━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 💚 Navigation commands ( inside and outside directory )

✔️ `cd` = change directory <br/>
Ex. <br/>
➔ `cd desktop` ( in our current directory there are many folders so `cd folder_Name` we can go to that folder ) <br/>
➔ `cd desktop/parthcodes` ( in desktop folder we are going to the parthcodes folder ) <br/>
➔ `cd ..` ( back button - navigate to parent directory ) <br/>
➔ `cd ../..` ( going to parents's parent drectory ) <br/>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### 💚 Paths ( absolute and relative )

➔ `tree` to show the hirechery diagram or folder structure
<br/>
➔ `cd desktop/parthcodes` --> relative path ( dependent on current location/ directory )  <br/>
➔ `cd /c/Users/Administrator/desktop/parthcodes` --> absolute path  ( start with / slash after cd )   <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
⚠️ `man` command is not working with git bash so use ✔️ `command_Name --help`  <br/>

➔ `ls -/a` <br/>
